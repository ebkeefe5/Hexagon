			<p class="instructions">This is a 2 player alternating turn game. Red has the first move, but may not move in the center on the first turn, so it is unclear who has the advantage. Red wins by connecting the bottom and top of the board with an unbroken chain of red hexagons. Blue wins by connecting the left and right side of the board with an unbroken chain of blue hexagons. The pictures below show an example of a game where blue and red have each won, respectively</p>
