		<p>This is a 2 player alternating turn game. Red has the first move, but may not move in the center on the first turn, so it is unclear who has the advantage.
		During a turn, a player selects and claims a hexagon. The board itself has two red edges, and two green edges.Red wins by forming an unbroken chain of hexagons connecting the red edges before green can form an unbroken chain of hexagons connecting the green edges. Similiarly, green wins by forming an unbroken chain of hexagons connecting the green edges before red can form an unbroken chain of hexagons connecting the red edges.</p>
