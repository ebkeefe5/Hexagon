Bug Fixes
* fix bug where the AI sometimes "plays" with the opponent when it could just win
* don't need to check for game over condition unless at least 11 turns have been made

Strong Areas
Heuristic is strong
* length of unclaimed spots in opponents most central shortest path - length of unclaimed spots in your central shortest path
* min max AI is working well

Improvements
The main area for improvement is probably in moveGenerator.js

For each player's shortest path we only need to consider 3 moves.
* the most important move in between the two ends of the path
  * if there is a point vulnerable to being cut off consider that point. if there are multiple choose the most central one
  * if there is not a point vulnerable to being cut off consider the most central of the moves in between the two ends of the path

* for each end of the path, we have 4 ways to push towards the edge, denoted as X
  * most direct bridge pushing 2 rows/cols towards edge
  x
   x
    x

     X

  * bridge pushing 1 row/col towards edge in one direction
  x

      X

  * bridge pushing 1 row/col towards edge in other direction
  x
   x
    x
  X

  * continue most central line
  x

     X

 * for each end of the path, come up with a way to choose the best of those 4 moves

If we only consider at most 6 moves per search, we can consider about 5 levels deep, perhaps 6
